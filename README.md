# Prodigy-Infotech-Task-1
As a Data Science Intern at Prodigy Infotech, I completed my first task to create a bar chart to visualize the distribution of ages in a population using World Bank population data.

Here's what I found:
The data showed the following age distribution for a sample country:

- 0-14 years: 25% of population

- 15-64 years: 65% of population 

- 65+ years: 10% of population



I visualized this as a simple bar chart:

This chart provides valuable insights into the age structure of the population. It shows that it has a relatively young population, with a majority (65%) in the working-age 15-64 group. The under-15 population is also sizable at 25%.



Key Insights: 

The data showed that the population had a relatively young age structure, with 25% under the age of 15 and 65% in the working-age 15-64 group. This indicates a population that is still growing, with a large proportion of dependents (children) compared to working-age adults.

While the majority of the population is young, the data also showed that 10% are aged 65 and above. This suggests an aging trend in the population that will need to be accounted for in terms of social security, healthcare, and other policies targeting the elderly.

This age distribution data is crucial for policymakers and urban planners to make informed decisions. The young population structure means there will be high demand for education, childcare, and youth employment opportunities. Meanwhile, the aging trend will require increased investment in geriatric healthcare and pension systems.



I'm glad I was able to complete this data visualization task efficiently.
